# Customer_churn_prediction
This Machine Learning project helps to identify which customers are likely to stop using a service, so companies can take action to keep them.
We used the publicly available IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset. It contains 7,043 customer records and 21 features, including services subscribed, tenure, charges, and contract type.
